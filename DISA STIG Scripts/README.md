# DISA STIG Scripts

These scripts are to check and fix based on STIG requirements, now not all STIG requirements can be fixed via command line and some require configuration profiles pushed via a MDM. I did not include those configuration profiles as they posted on https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/. Please reach out for any recommendations or issues.
<br />
<br />
I've included the import DoD Certifcates script in here too, this will help import the required DoD certifcates into the system keychain
<br />

## Script Variables
Each Script will have variables that need to be adjusted to generate logs locally on the machine, please adjust accordingly to your needs.
